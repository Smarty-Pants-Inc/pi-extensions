# pi-files-widget

In-terminal file browser and diff viewer widget for Pi. Navigate files, view diffs, select code, and send comments to the agent without leaving the terminal and without interrupting your agent.

Directory symlinks are shown with a `↗` marker and can be expanded like normal folders.

## Install

**Quick install (Pi package manager):**

```bash
pi install npm:@signalridge/pi-files-widget
```

Optional tools (for richer rendering; `/readfiles` also works without them):

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install bat git-delta glow

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install -y bat git-delta glow
```

```bash
pi install npm:@signalridge/pi-files-widget
```

Then add to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "npm:@signalridge/pi-files-widget",
      "extensions": ["index.ts"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Local clone:**

Add to your Pi extensions list:

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    "./packages/pi-files-widget"
  ]
}
```

If you prefer symlinking into `~/.pi/agent/extensions`:

```bash
ln -sfn "$(pwd)/packages/pi-files-widget" ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-files-widget
```

Then reference it in your settings:

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    "~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-files-widget"
  ]
}
```

## Optional rendering tools

- `bat`: syntax highlighting
- `delta`: formatted diffs
- `glow`: markdown rendering

These tools are optional. If any are missing, the widget shows one warning per extension load in TUI mode, but `/readfiles` still opens. Without `bat`, files display as plain text with line numbers. Without `delta`, diffs use raw Git output (`git` is needed for Git status and diffs). Without `glow`, Markdown displays as source text, highlighted by `bat` when available. Installed tools continue to provide their richer rendering.

## Commands

- `/readfiles` - open the file browser in the current directory
- `/readfiles <path>` - open the file browser rooted at `<path>` (absolute, relative, or `~`-prefixed)

Diff viewing is built into the file viewer: changed tracked files open in diff mode by default; press `d` to toggle between diff and full-file view. Selection and comments are disabled in diff mode. Press `d` for the full file before selecting source lines.

## Browser keybindings

- `j/k` or `↑/↓`: move
- `Enter`: open file / expand folder
- `h/l` or `←/→`: collapse/expand folder
- `PgUp/PgDn`: page up/down
- `c`: toggle changed-only view
- `]` / `[`: next/prev changed file
- `/`: search (type to filter, `Esc` to exit)
- `u`: go up one directory (re-root to parent)
- `.`: jump back to the starting directory
- `+` / `-`: increase/decrease browser height
- `q`: close

## Viewer keybindings

- `j/k` or `↑/↓`: scroll
- `PgUp/PgDn`: page up/down
- `g/G`: top/bottom
- `d`: toggle diff (tracked files only)
- `m`: toggle rendered/raw view for Markdown files
- `/`: search (type to search)
- `n` / `N`: next/prev match
- `v`: source-line selection from the top of the file (not available in diff mode)
- `c`: comment on selected lines (inline prompt)
- `Enter`: new line in the comment editor
- `Ctrl+Enter` or `Ctrl+D`: send the comment (`Alt+Enter` also works when supported)
- `]` / `[`: next/prev changed file
- `+` / `-`: increase/decrease viewer height
- `q`: back to browser

## Notes

- Untracked files show as `[UNTRACKED]` and open in normal view.
- Searching in rendered Markdown switches to raw mode first. In rendered Markdown, the first `v` switches to raw; press `v` again to select source lines.
- Ordinary full-file viewing remains syntax-highlighted and may wrap long lines. Selection uses an unhighlighted source snapshot with exactly one source line per row, starting at line 1 rather than reusing rendered-row scroll positions. Long lines are clipped to the terminal width, not wrapped; comments include the entire selected source lines. The displayed line numbers, selected range, and comment snippet use the same source indices. Resizing or disk edits do not change an active selection/comment snapshot. Cancelling or sending restores ordinary viewing.
- When you browse outside the current project directory, inline comments on those files use absolute paths so the agent can still locate them. Files inside the project continue to use project-relative paths.
- Folder LOCs are shown only when the folder is collapsed (expanded folders would duplicate counts).
- Line counts load asynchronously; the header shows activity while counts are computed.
- Large non-git folders load progressively and may show `[partial]` while loading in safe mode.
- Change metadata refreshes every 3 seconds while `/readfiles` is open, including outside Git repositories.
- The robot badge marks successful agent write/edit results. A neutral `~` marks changes observed during a failed or cancelled call: these may be an already-written agent change or a concurrent human save, so authorship is unknown. Both appear in changed-only view and next/previous change navigation. A later successful write confirms attribution; session changes clear both sets.
